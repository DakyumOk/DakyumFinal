							<h1>History of Fintech</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/fintechhistory.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>A paper by Arneris, Barberis & Ross states that there are multiple eras in the fintech industry. Each of these periods saw a distinct level of innovation that led to different changes in how consumers interact with their money.</p>
							<p>Fintech 1.0 (1886-1967)</p>
							<p>The next step in the evolution of financial services is to build the infrastructure needed to support a global economy. The first transatlantic cable and Fedwire in the US helped pioneer the electronic fund transfer system. It was a revolutionary innovation that occurred during a time when transportation and infrastructure were still developing.</p>
                            <p>Fintech 2.0 (1967-2008)</p>
							<p>The first automated teller machine was introduced by Barclays in 1967. This marked the beginning of a technological revolution that led to the development of financial services that are now known as digital. During the 1970s, the world's first digital stock exchange was established by NASDAQ and SWIFT, a communication protocol between banks that facilitates cross-border payments. The rise of bank mainframe computers and the introduction of online banking during the 1980s ushered in a new era in the evolution of financial services. This new technology led to a shift in how people viewed financial institutions. During the 1990s, the first major movement toward digital banking occurred. PayPal was introduced in 1998 as a payment system that would foreshadow the future of financial services. Everything seemed to be going well in the economy, prompting then-UK Chancellor Gordon Brown to declare the "end of boom and bust." However, it was this particular crash — the global financial crisis of 2008 – that drew the curtain down on this era of fintech and sparked the innovation that would follow.</p>
                            <p>Fintech 3.0 (2008-Current)</p>
							<p>Lack of trust in banks, combined with regulatory changes, has opened the market to new players following the financial crisis. In 2009, Bitcoin was launched, followed by other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies.
                                The start-up era has arrived, with a thirst for innovation among investors and consumers fueling a flood of new products and services. Even established banks are beginning to operate and advertise themselves as start-ups, and Fintech 3.0 is defined by this shift away from the established banks of the Fintech 2.0 period.
                                To help with this, new technologies have emerged that make it easier to construct digital banking solutions by allowing third-party companies access to financial data through Open Banking.
                                Banking as a Service (BaaS) platforms such as Treezor and SolarisBank have made it easier for banks and other financial institutions to move away from complex legacy systems and start "neo-banks" — digital banks focused on enhancing client experience.
                                </p>
                            <p>Fintech 3.5</p>
                            <p>Someone threw a cable under the Atlantic in the Fintech 1.0 era in 1886, kicking off the way banks do business for the next century. Previous fintech eras didn't go much further than that wire under the sea in terms of geography, with the great majority of growth taking place in the developed world — primarily Europe and the United States.
                                Fintech 3.5 has been created to account for changes in consumer behaviour and internet availability in developing countries. China and India, which are about as far away as you can get from this connection, have the highest fintech usage. Because these countries do not have the same physical banking infrastructure as the West, they have been able to implement new solutions faster than their Western counterparts.
                                Fintech 3.5 represents a shift away from the western-dominated financial environment and embraces global achievements in digital banking.
